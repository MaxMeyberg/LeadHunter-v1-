This is a README that is isn't build by vibe coding, so it might be janky but should work.

Here's how this application works!

Fun Facts:

We won 2nd place in this hackathon:

The guy who won first place was a founding engineer at Figma, awesome guy btw, but this project didn't stand a chance against such a cracked fellow
