### Fun Facts

We won 2nd place in this hackathon:
https://ai-agents-hackathon-gtc.devpost.com/?_gl=1*l8urn7*_gcl_au*ODk5NjQyNTczLjE3NDAyNjMzNDM.*_ga*ODkyNzA3NzUwLjE3NDAyNjMzNDM.*_ga_0YHJK3Y10M*MTc0Mjc1MzIyMS42LjEuMTc0Mjc1MzIzOS4wLjAuMA..

The guy who won first place was a founding engineer at Figma, awesome guy btw, but this project didn't stand a chance against such a cracked fellow
