    If you are asking why tf this works w "next", imagine vibe coding for a project to semi-work, then going back to fix it
    But then a pro python developer comes and says "Why are't you using next?", and walks up to me to fix this issue
    The worst part is that everything inside of that "next" is actuallu from the Docs
    from the API, so if you genuinely want to hurt yourself worse than my first time creating an account for Microsoft Azure, be my guest, but be warned
